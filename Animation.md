## Animation

We use animations in several places.

First when we deal the cards - there's an animation to spread the cards into a grid.

Second when we flip a card - we show the card rotating.

There's a wiggle effect we use when we match two cards or win (all the cards wiggle).

Lastly, there's an animation when the play wins - one of either fireworks, confetti or balloons.
