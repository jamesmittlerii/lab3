## Animation

We use animations in several places.

First when we deal the cards - there's an animation to spread the cards into a grid.

Second when we flip a card - we show the card rotating.

There's a wiggle effect we use when we match two cards or win (all the cards wiggle).

Lastly, there's an animation when the play wins - one of either [fireworks](./lab3/FireworksView.swift), [confetti](./lab3/ConfettiView.swift) or [balloons](./lab3/BalloonAscentView.swift).
